    This application is built using flask and employs a K-means algorithm to detect the
    events using geo-tagged tweets web scrapping and clustering using machine learning techniques.. K-means akgorithm is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that 
    identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while
    keeping the centroids as small as possible. The application allows the user to uppload the data and
    select the number of clusters to be formed. The 'Get Result' button displays the output from k-means
    algorithm. Please note that this app only accepts csv files.
